## Murmur
This is the very first website I finished.
Got so many fun during process. Lots of unknow issues too.
- Unable to got API data.
- Unable to create account by firebase.
- Some cool CSS effects, like sketch image in single cocktail page were too hard to be finished.
- Page not re-rendered.
- Page re-rendered infinity.
- Loading speed was too slow because of image size.
- etc.

Was thinking about aborting the apple-like effect as it might be too difficult for me, a website starter.\
I'm glad i didn't give up. The effect is so beautiful.

Hopefully everything is working well.
